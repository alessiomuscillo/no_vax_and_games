In this repository you may find the data and text of a survey we conducted on a representative sample of the Italian population. 
The main paper is "No-vaxxers are different in public good games" by M. Basili, A. Muscillo and P. Pin.

Paper's abstract:

In September 2021 we conducted a survey of 1,482 people in Italy, during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. In the first part
of the survey we performed three simple tests to examine players’ behavior during standard tasks with monetary incentives to
measure their risk attitudes, willingness to contribute to a public good in an experimental game, and their beliefs about others’
behavior. In the second part, we asked respondents if they were vaccinated and, if not, for what reason. We defined no-vaxxers
those (approximately 12% of the sample) who did not yet start the vaccination process and declared that they intended not
to do it in the future. We find that no-vaxxers contribute less to the public good in the experimental game because they trust
others less to do so. Moreover, based on the results of the three tests we extrapolated a classification based on the benchmark
of rationality and other-regarding preferences for each respondent, and we found that in this respect no-vaxxers do not differ
from the rest of the population.
